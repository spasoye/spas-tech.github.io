# Business Structure

I am located in Zagreb, Croatia. I am available for both local and remote 
projects, ensuring flexibility to meet your needs.

My business operates as a flat-tax sole proprietorship, locally known as "pau≈°alni 
obrt." This structure allows for simplified tax reporting and is designed for 
small businesses with lower revenue thresholds.

In addition to my technical skills, I prioritize clear communication and 
collaboration with my clients. I believe that understanding your vision and 
requirements is crucial for delivering successful projects. I am committed to 
providing regular updates and being responsive to your feedback throughout the 
development process.
