# About me

Hi, I’m Ivan Spasić, an embedded firmware developer with a passion for creating efficient, reliable, and innovative solutions. I graduated from the University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, with a degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, specializing in embedded systems and firmware development.

With years of hands-on experience, I’ve honed my skills in low-level programming, firmware optimization, and hardware-software integration. My work spans a wide range of platforms, including ESP32, STM32, Nordic Semiconductor, and Single Board Computers (SBC) like Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone, which have become a key part of my projects. I’m skilled in integrating software solutions like FreeRTOS, Zephyr, and MicroPython to build robust and scalable embedded systems.

I also specialize in embedded Linux applications, using device tree structures to ensure seamless integration, optimizing firmware for peak performance, and customizing embedded Linux environments. My expertise extends to modern connectivity technologies such as BLE, WiFi, LoRa, and IoT protocols, driving the next generation of connected devices.

I’m a strong advocate for FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) and OSH (Open Source Hardware), dedicating a lot of my free time to personal projects, exploring new technologies, and contributing to open-source communities. One of my major interests is researching and implementing Home Assistant, a popular open-source home automation platform, which has expanded my knowledge of network setups and self-hosting solutions.

Over the years, I’ve contributed to various projects, from IoT solutions and connectivity applications to real-time embedded systems, continually deepening my understanding of embedded development. I’m always eager to face new challenges with creative and efficient solutions.

Whether you need firmware developed from scratch, existing code optimized, or guidance on integrating advanced technologies, I’m here to help. My focus is to deliver tailored, stable, and efficient solutions for your needs.
