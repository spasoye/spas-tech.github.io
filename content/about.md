Hi, I’m Ivan Spasić, an embedded firmware developer with a passion for creating efficient, reliable, and innovative solutions. I graduated from the University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, with a degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, specializing in embedded systems and firmware development.

With years of hands-on experience, I’ve honed my skills in low-level programming, firmware optimization, and hardware-software integration. My work spans a wide range of platforms and technologies, including ESP32, STM32, Nordic Semiconductor, and more. I’m proficient in integrating software solutions like FreeRTOS, Zephyr, and MicroPython to build robust and scalable embedded systems.

I also specialize in embedded Linux applications, working with device tree structures to ensure seamless hardware-software integration, optimizing firmware for peak performance, and setting up tailored embedded Linux environments. My expertise extends to modern connectivity technologies such as BLE, WiFi, LoRa, and IoT protocols, which power the next generation of smart, connected devices.

Over the years, I’ve contributed to a variety of projects, from developing IoT solutions and connectivity applications to building real-time embedded systems. Each project has deepened my understanding of the challenges and opportunities in the embedded space, and I’m always eager to tackle new problems with creative and efficient solutions.

I’m a strong advocate for FOSS (Free and Open Source Software), and much of my free time is dedicated to personal projects, learning new technologies, and contributing to open-source communities. A significant portion of my efforts goes into researching and implementing Home Assistant, a popular open-source home automation platform. This has not only deepened my knowledge of home automation but also expanded my expertise in network setup and self-hosting solutions.

Whether you need firmware developed from scratch, existing code optimized for better performance, or guidance on integrating cutting-edge technologies, I’m here to help. My goal is to deliver solutions that are stable, efficient, and tailored to your unique needs.
